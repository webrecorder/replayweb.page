# Loading Archived Items

ReplayWeb.page can load archived items from the local filesystem, or from remote locations. If you don't have any archived items yet, try archiving a website with [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page)!

## Loading Local Files

From [replayweb.page](https://replayweb.page), press the _Choose File..._ button, pick any local archived item file from your computer, then press _Load_ to start viewing the file's archived content.

The archived item is loaded directly in the browser and is _not_ uploaded anywhere â€” your data never leaves your computer!

Once loaded, the archived item will appear in the list of Loaded Archives and will be identified by its filename with a a `file://` URL as its source. This URL is not shareable as it doesn't exist outside of your computer.

To unload an archived item, click on the 'X'. Unloading an item does not delete the file from its original location.

## Loading Files from a URL

To load an archived item stored in a remote location, enter the URL of the file and press _Load_.

The archived item will be downloaded, either fully or on-demand (if possible) and presented when ready.

See the [Supported Locations](locations.md) page for details on supported external sources for serving archived items.

## Loading Files from Google Drive

In addition to loading remote content from URLs, ReplayWeb.page also supports loading WARC and WACZ files directly from Google Drive.

### Add-on Installation

* Press the _Install_ button, Google will walk you through the steps of installation.

### Usage

1. Navigate to any WARC or WACZ files that available on your Google Drive.

2. Under the file's _More Actions_ :bootstrap-three-dots-vertical: menu, select _Open With_ and choose _ReplayWeb.page_ from the menu.

This will redirect to ReplayWeb.page and begin loading the file. Items loaded from Google Drive will have a source URL starting with `googledrive://`.

Once an archived item has been successfully loaded, the app will display the archive viewer and you can begin exploring your loaded archive.
