Welcome to the ReplayWeb.page documentation! These docs contain the following sections:

- [User Guide](user-guide/index.md) — Introduction and reference for using ReplayWeb.page to view archived web content.
- [Embedding Docs](develop/embedding.md) — Information on integrating and embedding ReplayWeb.page as a web archive viewer into existing web sites.

## What is ReplayWeb.page?
[ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page) is an open-source, browser-based viewer that loads and renders static web archive files. It functions as a serverless (client side) replay tool that _doesn't_ require a server to coordinate what archived content should be retrieved from a large central repository. It allows web archives to be hosted on any regular web server and viewed in any modern browser.

### Key Features

- High-fidelity replay of archived items in several formats.
- Page search and URL search.
- Full text search support for archived items that include extracted text.
- On-demand, incremental loading of large files.
- Several options for fully-functional offline usage, including a standalone desktop app with Flash support.
- Support for embedding archived items directly into your website!
