Welcome to the ReplayWeb.page official docs. These docs contain the following sections:

- [Developer Docs](develop/embedding.md) — Information on developing and embedding ReplayWebpage into your projects.
- [User Guide](user-guide/index.md) — Instructions and reference for using ReplayWebpage to view archived web content.

## What is Replayweb.page?
[ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page) is an open-source, browser-based viewer that loads and renders static web archive files. It functions as a serverless (client side) replay tool that _doesn't_ require a server to coordinate what archived content should be retrieved from a large central repository.

### Key Features

- High-fidelity replay of archived items in several formats.
- Page search and URL search.
- Full text search support for archived items that include extracted text.
- On-demand, incremental loading of large files.
- Several options for fully-functional offline usage, including a standalone desktop app with Flash support.
- Support for embedding archived items directly into your website!
