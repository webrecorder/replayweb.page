## Supported Formats

While ReplayWeb.page aims to support a variety of formats for archived web content, for best performance we recommend using WACZ files. To archive webpages to WACZ files on a per-page basis, we recommend [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page). If you need to crawl and save entire websites, check out [Browsertrix](https://browsertrix.com).

ReplayWeb.Page supports the following file formats listed as "Supported". Format type is determined based on the file's extension.

| Format  | Extensions          | Status         |
