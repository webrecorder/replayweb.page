This component works in all modern browsers, and has several configuration options that allow for control over the initial URL or snapshot to display from the archive when the component loads. The component can load WACZ files, WARC files and other formats.</p> <p>The <code>&lt;replay-web-page&gt;</code> web component consists of a \"backend\" service worker, which emulates a web server, and a \"frontend\" UI, though in reality both are scripts running in the browser - there is no web server!</p> <p>Tip: Serving web archives efficiently with WACZ files</p> <p>While other web archive filetypes may require ReplayWeb.page to download them in their entirety before viewing, WACZ files allow the service worker to pull individual resources from the file as they are requested by the user. Full retrieval of the WACZ by ReplayWeb.page is not required as long as the server delivering the WACZ file supports HTTP range requests. This means that serving archived content from WACZ files is effectively as bandwidth efficient as any other web content!</p>"},{"location":"docs/embedding/#example","title":"Example","text":""},{"location":"docs/embedding/#loading-the-replaywebpage-ui-frontend","title":"Loading the ReplayWeb.page UI (Frontend)","text":"<p>To embed a WACZ stored at <code>https://replayweb.page/docs/examples/tweet-example.wacz</code>, add the following <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to your HTML page to load the user interface from the jsDelivr CDN, and use the <code>&lt;replay-web-page&gt;</code> component to point to the WACZ:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@2.4.3/ui.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;replay-web-page source=\"https://replayweb.page/docs/examples/tweet-example.wacz\"\nurl=\"https://oembed.link/https://twitter.com/webrecorder_io/status/1565881026215219200\"&gt;&lt;/replay-web-page&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the <code>source</code> attribute is pointing to the location of the WACZ file (in this case published on AWS S3) and the <code>url</code> attribute is used to indicate what URL to display from the archived item after the component loads.</p>"},{"location":"docs/embedding/#loading-the-service-worker-backend","title":"Loading the Service Worker (Backend)","text":"<p>ReplayWeb.page's backend is a service worker which intercepts requests for URLs and looks for them in your loaded archived item. Service workers are just JavaScript files and can be loaded from the CDN (Content Delivery Network), it is necessary to add a service worker path from where the web archive will be served to a local path. We use <code>/replay</code> in these examples, but it can be anything. Since the service worker takes over the rendering of this path, it should be a path that is otherwise non-existent (serves a 404) from the actual web server.</p> <p>To do this, create a <code>/replay</code> subdirectory and in it, a new JavaScript file (<code>/replay/sw.js</code>) and copy the following to the file:</p> <pre><code>importScripts(\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@2.4.3/sw.js\");\n</code></pre> <p>If the HTML above was added to <code>https://example.com/path/my-web-archive-embed.html</code> then the <code>sw.js</code> should be added such that it is at: <code>https://example.com/path/replay/sw.js</code>.</p> <p>This has the affect imports the actual server worker from the CDN, serving it on your site <code>https://example.com/replay/sw.js</code> and allowing it to render web archives on the <code>/replay/</code> path.</p> <p>That's it! Loading <code>https://example.com/path/my-web-archive-embed.html</code> should now load the web archive.</p> <p>Be sure to add width and height styles to the <code>&lt;replay-web-page&gt;</code> tag as needed to scale the embed, and replace <code>https://replayweb.page/docs/examples/example.wacz</code> with any web archive hosted on your site.</p> Info: Loading files from different servers <p>If the file is loaded from a different origin, your site must have Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) access to download the web archive. See Loading Errors below for more info.</p> Best Practice: Controlling ReplayWeb.page versions <p>The above example uses the version number \"2.4.3\" in paths to load a specific version of ReplayWeb.page from a CDN. These URLs point to a specific version of ReplayWeb.page software released on NPM, meaning that your replay viewer should stay stable, even if ReplayWeb.page is updated.</p> <ul> <li><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@2.4.3/ui.js</code></li> <li><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage@2.4.3/sw.js</code></li> </ul> <p>Although ReplayWeb.page strives to remain backwards compatible, this addresses any potential issue of older embeds breaking when the replay system is updated.</p> <p>You can also use the latest stable release by omitting the version, and the URL will automatically load the latest published release:</p> <ul> <li><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage/ui.js</code></li> <li><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage/sw.js</code></li> </ul> <p>This is not recommended for production use as this is more likely to break in case there is a breaking change.</p> <p>For testing the very latest, it is possible to simply link to replayweb.page itself, eg. <code>https://replayweb.page/ui.js</code> and <code>https://replayweb.page/sw.js</code> but these are updated the most frequently and more likely to break.</p> <p>For production use, it is recommended to use a fixed version and explicitly upgrade as necessary.</p>"},{"location":"docs/embedding/#self-hosting","title":"Self Hosting","text":"<p>Sometimes it can be desirable to self-host the user interface, service worker, and WACZ files. This is useful for preventing tracking by CDNs, or to make it easier to host the content in one place without needing to work out the details of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). </p> <p>Following the same steps above, instead of loading the JavaScript and WACZ file from external locations, download the <code>ui.js</code> and <code>sw.js</code> JavaScript files and put them on the same server as the HTML that you are publishing. Link them accordingly replacing the CDN links in the guide above.</p>"},{"location":"docs/embedding/#example_1","title":"Example","text":"<p>If you are publishing a page at <code>https://example.com/path/my-web-archive-embed.html</code>, adjust the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element to load the ui from a location on your website:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script src=\"ui.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;replay-web-page source=\"example.wacz\" url=\"https://webrecorder.net\"&gt;&lt;/replay-web-page&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The following URLs would then need to resolve correctly:</p> <ul> <li>https://example.com/path/my-web-archive-embed.html</li> <li>https://example.com/path/example.wacz</li> <li>https://example.com/path/ui.js</li> <li>https://example.com/path/replay/sw.js</li> </ul> <p>When embedding more than one web archive on your site it can be helpful to centralize the location of the frontend and backend JavaScript, and potentially WACZ files. The <code>&lt;replay-web-page&gt;</code> component has a <code>replayBase</code> attribute that lets you define the location to load the <code>sw.js</code> service worker from. By default, <code>replayBase</code> is set to <code>./replay/</code> and so the service worker is loaded from <code>./replay/sw.js</code>.</p> <p>For example, if you publish your JavaScript files at:</p> <ul> <li>https://example.com/js/ui.js</li> <li>https://example.com/js/sw.js</li> <li>https://example.com/wacz/example.wacz</li> </ul> <p>Then you must adjust your HTML to reference the new resources:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script src=\"/js/ui.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;replay-web-page replayBase=\"/js/\" source=\"/wacz/example.wacz\" url=\"https://webrecorder.net\"&gt;&lt;/replay-web-page&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/embedding/#embed-modes","title":"Embed Modes","text":"<p>ReplayWeb.page offers four different ways to embed the archived content, including with or without the navigation UI, and with an archival information dropdown.
